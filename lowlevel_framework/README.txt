Steps for a successful first project:

	0) Make yourself familiar with the framework.

	1) Write all the code you need. Parsing of the given KISS files is already implemented. You will only need to
	   minimize/encode/convert everything.
	   Note: do not forget to use 'path+file' as an input argument.  

	2) Test your code for single kiss files in eclipse or whatever IDE you're using.

	3) Once you're convinced that everything is running fine it might be helpful to export your project as a executable jar 
	   and use shell scripts for automated testing. Make sure that all run configurations are correct. Don't forget to 
	   select a launch configuration.
	   
	4) In order to achieve better comparability we would like you to use the ABC library in the folder "abc". There is
	   also a bin file you can use.
	
	5) Good luck and have fun !
